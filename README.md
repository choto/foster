# The Circus Elephants
What are they thinking?
The circus elephants,
As they tramp round the ring each night? 
Do they wish that day
Were far away 
In the forest's leafy light?
Where they'd roam at will 
And could eat their fill
Far from human sight.
As the gentle giants
Perform their tricks
The children stare with delight 
But is it fair
Should they be there?
Is keeping them captive right?
